# Lubrication-system
# 🛠️ Arduino-Based Lubrication System Controller

This project controls a lubrication pump using an Arduino, BTS7960 motor driver, and a 3-cell LiPo battery. It calculates flow rate based on engine RPM input and adjusts pump voltage accordingly using PWM. Designed with a custom 3D-printed settling chamber for uniform lubricant distribution.

🔧 Built using: Arduino, BTS7960, LM2596, 3D-printed chamber, and LiPo power.
